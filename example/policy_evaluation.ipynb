    "## 1. Problem description\n",
    "\n",
    "For a general description of the contextual bandits problem, see the first part of the package's guide [Online Contextual Bandits](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/david-cortes/contextualbandits/blob/master/example/online_contextual_bandits.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "The previous two guides [Online Contextual Bandits](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/david-cortes/contextualbandits/blob/master/example/online_contextual_bandits.ipynb) and [Off-policy Learning in Contextual Bandits](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/david-cortes/contextualbandits/blob/master/example/offpolicy_learning.ipynb) evaluated the performance of different policies by looking at the actions they would have chosen in a fully-labeled dataset for multi-label classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in contextual bandits settings one doesn't have access to fully-labeled data, and the data that one has is usually very biased, as it is collected through some policy that aims to maximize rewards. In this situation, it is a lot more difficult to evaluate the performance of a new policy. This module deals with such problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "** *\n",
    "<a id=\"p2\"></a>\n",
    "## 2. Methods\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "This module implements three policy evaluation methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `evaluateRejectionSampling` (see _\"A contextual-bandit approach to personalized news article recommendation\"_), for both online and offline policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `evaluateDoublyRobust` (see _\"Doubly Robust Policy Evaluation and Learning\"_).\n",
    "\n",
    "* `evaluateNCIS` (see _\"Offline a/b testing for recommender systems\"_)\n",
    "\n",
    "These should ideally be based on a train-test split - that is, the policy is trained with some data and evaluated on different data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The best way to obtain a good estimate of the performance of a policy is to collect some data on which actions are chosen at random. When such data is available, one can iterate through it, let the policy choose an action for each observation, and if it matches with what was chosen, take it along with its rewards for evaluation purposes, skip it if not. This simple rejection sampling method is unbiased and lets you evaluate both online and offline algorithms. **It must be stressed that evaluating data like this only works when the actions of this test sample are chosen at random, otherwise the estimates will be biased (and likely very wrong)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "When such data is not available and there is reasonable variety of actions chosen, other options are doubly-robust estimates and inverse-propensity-adjusted estimates. The first one is meant for the case of continuous rewards though, and doesn't work as well with discrete rewards, especially when there are many labels, but can still be tried.\n",
    "\n",
    "The doubly-robust estimate requires, as it names suggests, two estimates: one of the reward that each arm will give, and another of the probability or score that the policy that collected the data gave to each arm it chose for each observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The estimates based on inverse-prosensity corrections require probabilistic distributions over the chosen arms, which **this package does not produce** as it follows different paradigms, and as such, cannot really be used properly with the kind of data that is shown here, and its outputs will not have the same properties as described in the references, but it can still provide an improvement in the estimations.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different ways of building a reward estimator for the doubly-robust method. One option is to fit a (non-online) model to both the train and test sets to make reward estimates on the test set, or fit it only on the test set (while the policy to be evaluated is fitted to the training set); or perhaps even use the score estimates from the old policy (which chose the actions on the training and test data) or from the new policy. The function `evaluateDoublyRobust` provides an API that can accomodate all these methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "** *\n",
    "<a id=\"p3\"></a>\n",
    "## 3. Experiments\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like in the previous guide [Off-policy Learning in Contextual Bandits](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/david-cortes/contextualbandits/blob/master/example/offpolicy_learning.ipynb), I will simualate data generated from a policy by fitting a logistic regression model with a sample of the **fully-labeled** data, then let it choose actions for some more data, and take those actions and rewards as input for a new policy, along with the estimated reward probabilities for the actions that were chosen.\n",
    "\n",
    "The new policy will then be evaluated on a test sample with actions already pre-selected, and the estimates from the methods here will be compared with the real rewards, which we can know because the data is fully labeled.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data are again the Bibtext dataset, plus the larger Mediamill dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "** *\n",
