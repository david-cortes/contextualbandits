        Adds a new arm to the pool of choices

        Parameters
        ----------
        arm_name : object
            Name for this arm. Only applicable when using named arms. If None, will use the name of the last
            arm plus 1 (will only work when the names are integers).
        fitted_classifier : object
            If a classifier has already been fit to rewards coming from this arm, you can pass it here, otherwise,
            will be started from the same 'base_classifier' as the initial arms. If using bootstrapped methods or methods from this module which do not
            accept arbitrary classifiers as input,
            don't pass a classifier here (unless using the classes like e.g. `utils._BootstrappedClassifierBase`).
            If the constructor was called with different ``base_algorithm`` per arm, must pass a
            base classifier here. Not applicable for the classes that do not take a ``base_algorithm``.
        n_w_rew : int
            Number of trials/rounds with rewards coming from this arm (only used when using a beta prior or smoothing).
        n_wo_rew : int
            Number of trials/rounds without rewards coming from this arm (only used when using a beta prior or smoothing).
        smoothing : None, tuple (a,b), or list
            Smoothing parameters to use for this arm (see documentation of the class constructor
            for details). If ``None`` and if the ``smoothing`` passed to the constructor didn't have
            separate entries per arm, will use the same ``smoothing`` as was passed in the constructor.
            If no ``smoothing`` was passed to the constructor, the ``smoothing`` here will be ignored.
            Must pass a ``smoothing`` here if the constructor was passed a ``smoothing`` with different entries per arm.
        beta_prior : None or tuple((a,b), n)
            Beta prior to use for this arm. See the class' documenation for details.
            Must be passed if the constructor was provided different beta priors per arm.
            If ``None`` and the constructor had a single ``beta_prior``, will use that same
            ``beta_prior`` for this new arm.
            Note that ``n_w_rew`` and ``n_wo_rew`` will be counted towards the threshold 'n'
            in here.
            Cannot be passed if the constructor did not have a ``beta_prior``.
        refit_buffer_X : array(m, n) or None
            Refit buffer of 'X' data to use for the new arm. Ignored when using
            'batch_train=False' or 'refit_buffer=None'.
        refit_buffer_r : array(m,) or None
            Refit buffer of rewards data to use for the new arm. Ignored when using
            'batch_train=False' or 'refit_buffer=None'.
        f_grad_norm : function
            Gradient calculation function to use for this arm. This is only
            for the policies that make choices according to active learning
            criteria, and only for situations in which the policy was passed
            different functions for each arm.
        case_one_class : function
            Gradient workaround function for single-class data. This is only
            for the policies that make choices according to active learning
            criteria, and only for situations in which the policy was passed

    Bootstrapped Upper Confidence Bound

    Obtains an upper confidence bound by taking the percentile of the predictions from a
    set of classifiers, all fit with different bootstrapped samples (multiple samples per arm).
    
    Note
    ----
    When fitting the algorithm to data in batches (online), it's not possible to take an
    exact bootstrapped sample, as the sample is not known in advance. In theory, as the sample size
    grows to infinity, the number of times that an observation appears in a bootstrapped sample is
    distributed :math:`\sim Poisson(1)`. However, assigning random gamma-distributed weights to observations
    produces a more stable effect, so it also has the option to assign weights randomly :math:`\sim Gamma(1,1)`.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    base_algorithm : obj or list
        Base binary classifier for which each sample for each class will be fit.
        Will look for, in this order:
            1) A 'predict_proba' method with outputs (n_samples, 2), values in [0,1], rows suming to 1
            2) A 'decision_function' method with unbounded outputs (n_samples,) to which it will apply a sigmoid function.
            3) A 'predict' method with outputs (n_samples,) with values in [0,1].
        Can also pass a list with a different (or already-fit) classifier for each arm.
    nchoices : int or list-like
        Number of arms/labels to choose from. Can also pass a list, array, or Series with arm names, in which case
        the outputs from predict will follow these names and arms can be dropped by name, and new ones added with a
        custom name.
    nsamples : int
        Number of bootstrapped samples per class to take.
    percentile : int [0,100]
        Percentile of the predictions sample to take
    beta_prior : str 'auto', None, tuple ((a,b), n), or list[tuple((a,b), n)]
        If not 'None', when there are less than 'n' samples with and without
        a reward from a given arm, it will predict the score for that class as a
        random number drawn from a beta distribution with the prior
        specified by 'a' and 'b'. If set to "auto", will be calculated as:
            beta_prior = ((3/log2(nchoices), 4), 2)
        Can also pass different priors per arm, in which case they should be passed
        as a list of tuples.
        Note that it will only generate one random number per arm, so the 'a'
        parameter should be higher than for other methods.
        This parameter can have a very large impact in the end results, and it's
        recommended to tune it accordingly - scenarios with low expected reward rates
        should have priors that result in drawing small random numbers, whereas
        scenarios with large expected reward rates should have stronger priors and
        tend towards larger random numbers. Also, the more arms there are, the smaller
        the optimal expected value for these random numbers.
        Recommended to use only one of ``beta_prior`` or ``smoothing``.
    smoothing : None, tuple (a,b), or list
        If not None, predictions will be smoothed as yhat_smooth = (yhat*n + a)/(n + b),
        where 'n' is the number of times each arm was chosen in the training data.
        Can also pass it as a list of tuples with different 'a' and 'b' parameters for each arm
        (e.g. if there are arm features, these parameters can be determined through a different model).
        This will not work well with non-probabilistic classifiers such as SVM, in which case you might
        want to define a class that embeds it with some recalibration built-in.
        Recommended to use only one of ``beta_prior`` or ``smoothing``.
    noise_to_smooth : bool
        If passing ``smoothing``, whether to add a small amount of random
        noise :math:`\sim Uniform(0, 10^{-12})` in order to break ties at random instead of
        choosing the smallest arm index.
        Ignored when passing ``smoothing=None``.
    batch_train : bool
        Whether the base algorithm will be fit to the data in batches as it comes (streaming),
        or to the whole dataset each time it is refit. Requires a classifier with a
        'partial_fit' method.
    refit_buffer : int or None
        Number of observations per arm to keep as a reserve for passing to
        'partial_fit'. If passing it, up until the moment there are at least this
        number of observations for a given arm, that arm will keep the observations
        when calling 'fit' and 'partial_fit', and will translate calls to
        'partial_fit' to calls to 'fit' with the new plus stored observations.
        After the reserve number is reached, calls to 'partial_fit' will enlarge
        the data batch with the stored observations, and old stored observations
        will be gradually replaced with the new ones (at random, not on a FIFO
        basis). This technique can greatly enchance the performance when fitting
        the data in batches, but memory consumption can grow quite large.
        If passing sparse CSR matrices as input to 'fit' and 'partial_fit',
        these will be converted to dense once they go into this reserve, and
        then converted back to CSR to augment the new data.
        Calls to 'fit' will override this reserve.
        Ignored when passing 'batch_train=False'.
    deep_copy_buffer : bool
        Whether to make deep copies of the data that is stored in the
        reserve for ``refit_buffer``. If passing 'False', when the reserve is
        not yet full, these will only store shallow copies of the data, which
        is faster but will not let Python's garbage collector free memory
        after deleting the data, and if the original data is overwritten, so will
        this buffer.
        Ignored when not using ``refit_buffer``.
    assume_unique_reward : bool
        Whether to assume that only one arm has a reward per observation. If set to 'True',
        whenever an arm receives a reward, the classifiers for all other arms will be
        fit to that observation too, having negative label.
    batch_sample_method : str, either 'gamma' or 'poisson'
        How to simulate bootstrapped samples when training in batch mode (online).
        See Note.
    random_state : int, None, RandomState, or Generator
        Either an integer which will be used as seed for initializing a
        ``Generator`` object for random number generation, a ``RandomState``
        object (from NumPy) from which to draw an integer, or a ``Generator``
        object (from NumPy), which will be used directly.
        While this controls random number generation for this meteheuristic,
        there can still be other sources of variations upon re-runs, such as
        data aggregations in parallel (e.g. from OpenMP or BLAS functions).
    njobs_arms : int or None
        Number of parallel jobs to run (for dividing work across arms). If passing None will set it to 1.
        If passing -1 will set it to the number of CPU cores. Note that if the base algorithm is itself
        parallelized, this might result in a slowdown as both compete for available threads, so don't set
        parallelization in both. The total number of parallel jobs will be njobs_arms * njobs_samples. The parallelization uses shared memory, thus you will only
        see a speed up if your base classifier releases the Python GIL, and will
        otherwise result in slower runs.
    njobs_samples : int or None
        Number of parallel jobs to run (for dividing work across samples within one arm). If passing None
        will set it to 1. If passing -1 will set it to the number of CPU cores. The total number of parallel
        jobs will be njobs_arms * njobs_samples.
        The parallelization uses shared memory, thus you will only
        see a speed up if your base classifier releases the Python GIL, and will
        otherwise result in slower runs.

class BootstrappedTS(_BasePolicyWithExploit):
    """
    Bootstrapped Thompson Sampling
    
    Performs Thompson Sampling by fitting several models per class on bootstrapped samples,
    then makes predictions by taking one of them at random for each class.
    
    Note
    ----
    When fitting the algorithm to data in batches (online), it's not possible to take an
    exact bootstrapped sample, as the sample is not known in advance. In theory, as the sample size
    grows to infinity, the number of times that an observation appears in a bootstrapped sample is
    distributed :math:`\sim Poisson(1)`. However, assigning random gamma-distributed weights to observations
    produces a more stable effect, so it also has the option to assign weights randomly :math:`\sim Gamma(1,1)`.

    Note
    ----
    If you plan to make only one call to 'predict' between calls to 'fit' and have
    ``sample_unique=False``, you can pass ``nsamples=1`` without losing any precision.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    base_algorithm : obj
        Base binary classifier for which each sample for each class will be fit.
        Will look for, in this order:
            1) A 'predict_proba' method with outputs (n_samples, 2), values in [0,1], rows suming to 1
            2) A 'decision_function' method with unbounded outputs (n_samples,) to which it will apply a sigmoid function.
            3) A 'predict' method with outputs (n_samples,) with values in [0,1].
        Can also pass a list with a different (or already-fit) classifier for each arm.
    nchoices : int or list-like
        Number of arms/labels to choose from. Can also pass a list, array, or Series with arm names, in which case
        the outputs from predict will follow these names and arms can be dropped by name, and new ones added with a
        custom name.
    nsamples : int
        Number of bootstrapped samples per class to take.
    beta_prior : str 'auto', None, tuple ((a,b), n), or list[tuple((a,b), n)]
        If not 'None', when there are less than 'n' samples with and without
        a reward from a given arm, it will predict the score for that class as a
        random number drawn from a beta distribution with the prior
        specified by 'a' and 'b'. If set to "auto", will be calculated as:
            beta_prior = ((2/log2(nchoices), 4), 2)
        Can also pass different priors per arm, in which case they should be passed
        as a list of tuples.
        This parameter can have a very large impact in the end results, and it's
        recommended to tune it accordingly - scenarios with low expected reward rates
        should have priors that result in drawing small random numbers, whereas
        scenarios with large expected reward rates should have stronger priors and
        tend towards larger random numbers. Also, the more arms there are, the smaller
        the optimal expected value for these random numbers.
        Recommended to use only one of ``beta_prior`` or ``smoothing``.
    smoothing : None, tuple (a,b), or list
        If not None, predictions will be smoothed as yhat_smooth = (yhat*n + a)/(n + b),
        where 'n' is the number of times each arm was chosen in the training data.
        Can also pass it as a list of tuples with different 'a' and 'b' parameters for each arm
        (e.g. if there are arm features, these parameters can be determined through a different model).
        This will not work well with non-probabilistic classifiers such as SVM, in which case you might
        want to define a class that embeds it with some recalibration built-in.
        Recommended to use only one of ``beta_prior`` or ``smoothing``.
    noise_to_smooth : bool
        If passing ``smoothing``, whether to add a small amount of random
        noise :math:`\sim Uniform(0, 10^{-12})` in order to break ties at random instead of
        choosing the smallest arm index.
        Ignored when passing ``smoothing=None``.
    sample_unique : bool
        Whether to use a different bootstrapped classifier per row at each arm when
        calling 'predict'. If passing 'False', will take the same bootstrapped
        classifier within an arm for all the rows passed in a single call to 'predict'.
        Passing 'False' is a faster alternative, but the theoretically correct way
        is using a different one per row.
        Forced to 'True' when passing ``sample_weighted=True``.
    sample_weighted : bool
        Whether to take a weighted average from the predictions from each bootstrapped
        classifier at a given arm, with random weights. This will make the predictions
        more variable (i.e. more randomness in exploration). The alternative (and
        default) is to take a prediction from a single classifier each time.
    batch_train : bool
        Whether the base algorithm will be fit to the data in batches as it comes (streaming),
        or to the whole dataset each time it is refit. Requires a classifier with a
        'partial_fit' method.
    refit_buffer : int or None
        Number of observations per arm to keep as a reserve for passing to
        'partial_fit'. If passing it, up until the moment there are at least this
        number of observations for a given arm, that arm will keep the observations
        when calling 'fit' and 'partial_fit', and will translate calls to
        'partial_fit' to calls to 'fit' with the new plus stored observations.
        After the reserve number is reached, calls to 'partial_fit' will enlarge
        the data batch with the stored observations, and old stored observations
        will be gradually replaced with the new ones (at random, not on a FIFO
        basis). This technique can greatly enchance the performance when fitting
        the data in batches, but memory consumption can grow quite large.
        If passing sparse CSR matrices as input to 'fit' and 'partial_fit',
        these will be converted to dense once they go into this reserve, and
        then converted back to CSR to augment the new data.
        Calls to 'fit' will override this reserve.
        Ignored when passing 'batch_train=False'.
    deep_copy_buffer : bool
        Whether to make deep copies of the data that is stored in the
        reserve for ``refit_buffer``. If passing 'False', when the reserve is
        not yet full, these will only store shallow copies of the data, which
        is faster but will not let Python's garbage collector free memory
        after deleting the data, and if the original data is overwritten, so will
        this buffer.
        Ignored when not using ``refit_buffer``.
    assume_unique_reward : bool
        Whether to assume that only one arm has a reward per observation. If set to 'True',
        whenever an arm receives a reward, the classifiers for all other arms will be
        fit to that observation too, having negative label.
    batch_sample_method : str, either 'gamma' or 'poisson'
        How to simulate bootstrapped samples when training in batch mode (online).
        See Note.
    random_state : int, None, RandomState, or Generator
        Either an integer which will be used as seed for initializing a
        ``Generator`` object for random number generation, a ``RandomState``
        object (from NumPy) from which to draw an integer, or a ``Generator``
        object (from NumPy), which will be used directly.
        While this controls random number generation for this meteheuristic,
        there can still be other sources of variations upon re-runs, such as
        data aggregations in parallel (e.g. from OpenMP or BLAS functions).
    njobs_arms : int or None
        Number of parallel jobs to run (for dividing work across arms). If passing None will set it to 1.
        If passing -1 will set it to the number of CPU cores. Note that if the base algorithm is itself
        parallelized, this might result in a slowdown as both compete for available threads, so don't set
        parallelization in both. The total number of parallel jobs will be njobs_arms * njobs_samples.
        The parallelization uses shared memory, thus you will only
        see a speed up if your base classifier releases the Python GIL, and will
        otherwise result in slower runs.
    njobs_samples : int or None
        Number of parallel jobs to run (for dividing work across samples within one arm). If passing None
        will set it to 1. If passing -1 will set it to the number of CPU cores. The total number of parallel
        jobs will be njobs_arms * njobs_samples.
        The parallelization uses shared memory, thus you will only
        see a speed up if your base classifier releases the Python GIL, and will
        otherwise result in slower runs.

    Logistic Regression with Confidence Interval

    Logistic regression classifier which constructs an upper bound on the
    predicted probabilities through a confidence interval calculated from
    the variance-covariance matrix of the fitted coefficients.

    Note
    ----
    This strategy is implemented for comparison purposes only and it's not
    recommended to rely on it, particularly not for large datasets.

    Note
    ----
    This strategy does not support fitting the data in batches ('partial_fit'
    will not be available), nor does it support using any other classifier.
    See 'BootstrappedUCB' for a more generalizable version.

    Note
    ----
    This strategy requires each fitted classifier to store a square matrix with
    dimension equal to the number of features. Thus, memory consumption can grow
    very high with this method.

    Parameters
    ----------
    nchoices : int or list-like
        Number of arms/labels to choose from. Can also pass a list, array, or Series with arm names, in which case
        the outputs from predict will follow these names and arms can be dropped by name, and new ones added with a

    percentile : int [0,100]
        Percentile of the confidence interval to take.
    fit_intercept : bool
        Whether to add an intercept term to the models.
    lambda_ : float
        Strenght of the L2 regularization. Must be greater than zero.
    ucb_from_empty : bool
        Whether to make upper confidence bounds on arms with no observations according
        to the formula (ties are broken at random for
        them). Choosing this option leads to policies that usually start making random
        predictions until having sampled from all arms, and as such, it's not
        recommended when the number of arms is large relative to the number of rounds.
        Instead, it's recommended to use ``beta_prior``, which acts in the same way
        as for the other policies in this library.
    beta_prior : str 'auto', None, tuple ((a,b), n), or list[tuple((a,b), n)]
        If not 'None', when there are less than 'n' samples with and without
        a reward from a given arm, it will predict the score for that class as a
        random number drawn from a beta distribution with the prior
        specified by 'a' and 'b'. If set to "auto", will be calculated as:
            beta_prior = ((3/log2(nchoices), 4), 2)
        Can also pass different priors per arm, in which case they should be passed
        as a list of tuples.
        This parameter can have a very large impact in the end results, and it's
        recommended to tune it accordingly - scenarios with low expected reward rates
        should have priors that result in drawing small random numbers, whereas
        scenarios with large expected reward rates should have stronger priors and
        tend towards larger random numbers. Also, the more arms there are, the smaller
        the optimal expected value for these random numbers.
        Note that this method calculates upper bounds rather than expectations, so the 'a'
        parameter should be higher than for other methods.
        Recommended to use only one of ``beta_prior`` or ``smoothing``. Ignored when
        passing ``ucb_from_empty=True``.
    smoothing : None, tuple (a,b), or list
        If not None, predictions will be smoothed as yhat_smooth = (yhat*n + a)/(n + b),
        where 'n' is the number of times each arm was chosen in the training data.
        Can also pass it as a list of tuples with different 'a' and 'b' parameters for each arm
        (e.g. if there are arm features, these parameters can be determined through a different model).
        Recommended to use only one of ``beta_prior`` or ``smoothing``.
    noise_to_smooth : bool
        If passing ``smoothing``, whether to add a small amount of random
        noise :math:`\sim Uniform(0, 10^{-12})` in order to break ties at random instead of
        choosing the smallest arm index.

        Either an integer which will be used as seed for initializing a
        ``Generator`` object for random number generation, a ``RandomState``
        object (from NumPy) from which to draw an integer, or a ``Generator``

        data aggregations in parallel (e.g. from OpenMP or BLAS functions).
    njobs : int or None
        Number of parallel jobs to run. If passing None will set it to 1. If passing -1 will
        set it to the number of CPU cores. Be aware that the algorithm will use BLAS function calls,
        and if these have multi-threading enabled, it might result in a slow-down
        as both functions compete for available threads.

    sample_from : str, one of "coef", "ci"
        Whether to make predictions by sampling the model coefficients or by
        sampling the predicted value from a confidence interval around the best-fit
        coefficients.
    ci_from_empty : bool
        Whether to construct a confidence interval on arms with no observations
        according to a variance-covariance matrix given by the regulatization
        parameter alone.
        Ignored when passing ``sample_from='coef'``.
    multiplier : float
        Multiplier for the covariance matrix. Pass 1 to take it as-is.
        Ignored when passing ``sample_from='ci'``.
    n_presampled : None or int
        If sampling from coefficients, this denotes a number of coefficients to pre-sample
        after calling 'fit', which will be used later in the predictions. Pre-sampling
        a large number of coefficients can help to speed up predictions at the expense
        of longer fitting times, and is recommended if there is a large number of predictions
        between calls to 'fit'.
        If passing 'None' (the default), will not pre-sample a finite number of the coefficients
        at fitting time, but will rather sample (different) coefficients in calls to 'predict'.
        Ignored when passing ``sample_from="ci"``.
    fit_intercept : bool
        Whether to add an intercept term to the models.
    lambda_ : float
        Strenght of the L2 regularization. Must be greater than zero.
    sample_unique : bool
        Whether to sample different coefficients each time a prediction is to
        be made. If passing 'False', when calling 'predict', it will sample
        the same coefficients for all the observations in the same call to
        'predict', whereas if passing 'True', will use a different set of
        coefficients for each observation/row. Passing 'False' leads to an
        approach which is theoretically wrong, but as sampling coefficients
        can be very slow, using 'False' can provide a reasonable speed up
        without much of a performance penalty.
        Ignored when passing ``sample_from='ci'`` or ``n_presampled``.
    beta_prior : str 'auto', None, tuple ((a,b), n), or list[tuple((a,b), n)]
        If not 'None', when there are less than 'n' samples with and without

        Can also pass different priors per arm, in which case they should be passed

    noise_to_smooth : bool
        If passing ``smoothing``, whether to add a small amount of random
        noise :math:`\sim Uniform(0, 10^{-12})` in order to break ties at random instead of
        choosing the smallest arm index.
        Ignored when passing ``smoothing=None``.
    assume_unique_reward : bool
        Whether to assume that only one arm has a reward per observation. If set to 'True',

        fit to that observation too, having negative label.
    random_state : int, None, RandomState, or Generator
        Either an integer which will be used as seed for initializing a
        ``Generator`` object for random number generation, a ``RandomState``
        object (from NumPy) from which to draw an integer, or a ``Generator``
        object (from NumPy), which will be used directly.
        While this controls random number generation for this meteheuristic,
        there can still be other sources of variations upon re-runs, such as
        data aggregations in parallel (e.g. from OpenMP or BLAS functions).
    njobs : int or None
        Number of parallel jobs to run. If passing None will set it to 1. If passing -1 will
        set it to the number of CPU cores. Be aware that the algorithm will use BLAS function calls,
        and if these have multi-threading enabled, it might result in a slow-down
        as both functions compete for available threads.

class SeparateClassifiers(_BasePolicy):
    """
    Separate Clasifiers per arm
    
    Fits one classifier per arm using only the data on which that arm was chosen.
    Predicts as One-Vs-Rest, plus the usual metaheuristics from ``beta_prior``
    and ``smoothing``.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    base_algorithm : obj
        Base binary classifier for which each sample for each class will be fit.
        Will look for, in this order:
            1) A 'predict_proba' method with outputs (n_samples, 2), values in [0,1], rows suming to 1
            2) A 'decision_function' method with unbounded outputs (n_samples,) to which it will apply a sigmoid function.
            3) A 'predict' method with outputs (n_samples,) with values in [0,1].
        Can also pass a list with a different (or already-fit) classifier for each arm.
    nchoices : int or list-like
        Number of arms/labels to choose from. Can also pass a list, array, or Series with arm names, in which case
        the outputs from predict will follow these names and arms can be dropped by name, and new ones added with a
        custom name.
    beta_prior : str 'auto', None, tuple ((a,b), n), or list[tuple((a,b), n)]
        If not 'None', when there are less than 'n' samples with and without
        a reward from a given arm, it will predict the score for that class as a
        random number drawn from a beta distribution with the prior
        specified by 'a' and 'b'. If set to "auto", will be calculated as:
            beta_prior = ((2/log2(nchoices), 4), 2)
        Can also pass different priors per arm, in which case they should be passed
        as a list of tuples.
        This parameter can have a very large impact in the end results, and it's
        recommended to tune it accordingly - scenarios with low expected reward rates
        should have priors that result in drawing small random numbers, whereas
        scenarios with large expected reward rates should have stronger priors and
        tend towards larger random numbers. Also, the more arms there are, the smaller
        the optimal expected value for these random numbers.
        Recommended to use only one of ``beta_prior`` or ``smoothing``.
    smoothing : None, tuple (a,b), or list
        If not None, predictions will be smoothed as yhat_smooth = (yhat*n + a)/(n + b),
        where 'n' is the number of times each arm was chosen in the training data.
        Can also pass it as a list of tuples with different 'a' and 'b' parameters for each arm
        (e.g. if there are arm features, these parameters can be determined through a different model).
        This will not work well with non-probabilistic classifiers such as SVM, in which case you might
        want to define a class that embeds it with some recalibration built-in.
        Recommended to use only one of ``beta_prior`` or ``smoothing``.
    noise_to_smooth : bool
        If passing ``smoothing``, whether to add a small amount of random
        noise :math:`\sim Uniform(0, 10^{-12})` in order to break ties at random instead of
        choosing the smallest arm index.
        Ignored when passing ``smoothing=None``.
    batch_train : bool
        Whether the base algorithm will be fit to the data in batches as it comes (streaming),
        or to the whole dataset each time it is refit. Requires a classifier with a
        'partial_fit' method.
    refit_buffer : int or None
        Number of observations per arm to keep as a reserve for passing to
        'partial_fit'. If passing it, up until the moment there are at least this
        number of observations for a given arm, that arm will keep the observations
        when calling 'fit' and 'partial_fit', and will translate calls to
        'partial_fit' to calls to 'fit' with the new plus stored observations.
        After the reserve number is reached, calls to 'partial_fit' will enlarge
        the data batch with the stored observations, and old stored observations
        will be gradually replaced with the new ones (at random, not on a FIFO
        basis). This technique can greatly enchance the performance when fitting
        the data in batches, but memory consumption can grow quite large.
        If passing sparse CSR matrices as input to 'fit' and 'partial_fit',
        these will be converted to dense once they go into this reserve, and
        then converted back to CSR to augment the new data.
        Calls to 'fit' will override this reserve.
        Ignored when passing 'batch_train=False'.
    deep_copy_buffer : bool
        Whether to make deep copies of the data that is stored in the
        reserve for ``refit_buffer``. If passing 'False', when the reserve is
        not yet full, these will only store shallow copies of the data, which
        is faster but will not let Python's garbage collector free memory
        after deleting the data, and if the original data is overwritten, so will
        this buffer.
        Ignored when not using ``refit_buffer``.
    assume_unique_reward : bool
        Whether to assume that only one arm has a reward per observation. If set to 'True',
        whenever an arm receives a reward, the classifiers for all other arms will be
        fit to that observation too, having negative label.
    random_state : int, None, RandomState, or Generator
        Either an integer which will be used as seed for initializing a
        ``Generator`` object for random number generation, a ``RandomState``
        object (from NumPy) from which to draw an integer, or a ``Generator``
        object (from NumPy), which will be used directly.
        While this controls random number generation for this meteheuristic,
        there can still be other sources of variations upon re-runs, such as
        data aggregations in parallel (e.g. from OpenMP or BLAS functions).
    njobs : int or None
        Number of parallel jobs to run. If passing None will set it to 1. If passing -1 will
        set it to the number of CPU cores. Note that if the base algorithm is itself parallelized,
        this might result in a slowdown as both compete for available threads, so don't set
        parallelization in both. The parallelization uses shared memory, thus you will only
        see a speed up if your base classifier releases the Python GIL, and will
        otherwise result in slower runs.

    Adaptive Greedy
    
    Takes the action with highest estimated reward, unless that estimation falls below a certain
    threshold, in which case it takes a an action either at random or according to an active learning
    heuristic (same way as `ActiveExplorer`).

    Note
    ----
    The hyperparameters here can make a large impact on the quality of the choices. Be sure
    to tune the threshold (or percentile), decay, and prior (or smoothing parameters).
    
    Note
    ----
    The threshold for the reward probabilities can be set to a hard-coded number, or
    to be calculated dynamically by keeping track of the predictions it makes, and taking
    a fixed percentile of that distribution to be the threshold.
    In the second case, these are calculated in separate batches rather than in a sliding window.
    
    Can also be set to make choices in the same way as
    'ActiveExplorer' rather than random (see 'greedy_choice' parameter).
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    base_algorithm : obj
        Base binary classifier for which each sample for each class will be fit.
        Will look for, in this order:
            1) A 'predict_proba' method with outputs (n_samples, 2), values in [0,1], rows suming to 1
            2) A 'decision_function' method with unbounded outputs (n_samples,) to which it will apply a sigmoid function.
            3) A 'predict' method with outputs (n_samples,) with values in [0,1].
        Can also pass a list with a different (or already-fit) classifier for each arm.
    nchoices : int or list-like
        Number of arms/labels to choose from. Can also pass a list, array, or series with arm names, in which case
        the outputs from predict will follow these names and arms can be dropped by name, and new ones added with a
        custom name.
    window_size : int
        Number of predictions after which the threshold will be updated to the desired percentile.
    percentile : int in [0,100] or None
        Percentile of the predictions sample to set as threshold, below which actions are random.
        If None, will not take percentiles, will instead use the intial threshold and apply decay to it.
    decay : float (0,1) or None
        After each prediction, either the threshold or the percentile gets adjusted to:
            val_{t+1} = val_t*decay
    decay_type : str, either 'percentile' or 'threshold'
        Whether to decay the threshold itself or the percentile of the predictions to take after
        each prediction. Ignored when using 'decay=None'. If passing 'percentile=None' and 'decay_type=percentile',
        will be forced to 'threshold'.
    initial_thr : str 'auto' or float (0,1)
        Initial threshold for the prediction below which a random action is taken.
        If set to 'auto', will be calculated as initial_thr = 1 / (2 * sqrt(nchoices)).
        Note that if 'base_algorithm' has a 'decision_function' method, it will first apply a sigmoid function to the
        output, and then compare it to the threshold, so the threshold should lie between zero and one.
    beta_prior : str 'auto', None, tuple ((a,b), n), or list[tuple((a,b), n)]
        If not 'None', when there are less than 'n' samples with and without
        a reward from a given arm, it will predict the score for that class as a
        random number drawn from a beta distribution with the prior
        specified by 'a' and 'b'. If set to "auto", will be calculated as:
            beta_prior = ((3/nchoices, 4), 2)
        Can also pass different priors per arm, in which case they should be passed
        as a list of tuples.
        This parameter can have a very large impact in the end results, and it's
        recommended to tune it accordingly - scenarios with low expected reward rates
        should have priors that result in drawing small random numbers, whereas
        scenarios with large expected reward rates should have stronger priors and
        tend towards larger random numbers. Also, the more arms there are, the smaller
        the optimal expected value for these random numbers.
        Note that the default value for ``AdaptiveGreedy`` is different than from the
        other methods in this module, and it's recommended to experiment with different
        values of this hyperparameter.
        Recommended to use only one of ``beta_prior`` or ``smoothing``.
    smoothing : None, tuple (a,b), or list
        If not None, predictions will be smoothed as yhat_smooth = (yhat*n + a)/(n + b),
        where 'n' is the number of times each arm was chosen in the training data.
        Can also pass it as a list of tuples with different 'a' and 'b' parameters for each arm
        (e.g. if there are arm features, these parameters can be determined through a different model).
        This will not work well with non-probabilistic classifiers such as SVM, in which case you might
        want to define a class that embeds it with some recalibration built-in.
        Recommended to use only one of ``beta_prior`` or ``smoothing``.
    noise_to_smooth : bool
        If passing ``smoothing``, whether to add a small amount of random
        noise :math:`\sim Uniform(0, 10^{-12})` in order to break ties at random instead of
        choosing the smallest arm index.
        Ignored when passing ``smoothing=None``.
    batch_train : bool
        Whether the base algorithm will be fit to the data in batches as it comes (streaming),
        or to the whole dataset each time it is refit. Requires a classifier with a
        'partial_fit' method.
    refit_buffer : int or None
        Number of observations per arm to keep as a reserve for passing to
        'partial_fit'. If passing it, up until the moment there are at least this
        number of observations for a given arm, that arm will keep the observations
        when calling 'fit' and 'partial_fit', and will translate calls to
        'partial_fit' to calls to 'fit' with the new plus stored observations.
        After the reserve number is reached, calls to 'partial_fit' will enlarge
        the data batch with the stored observations, and old stored observations
        will be gradually replaced with the new ones (at random, not on a FIFO
        basis). This technique can greatly enchance the performance when fitting
        the data in batches, but memory consumption can grow quite large.
        If passing sparse CSR matrices as input to 'fit' and 'partial_fit',
        these will be converted to dense once they go into this reserve, and
        then converted back to CSR to augment the new data.
        Calls to 'fit' will override this reserve.
        Ignored when passing 'batch_train=False'.
    deep_copy_buffer : bool
        Whether to make deep copies of the data that is stored in the
        reserve for ``refit_buffer``. If passing 'False', when the reserve is
        not yet full, these will only store shallow copies of the data, which
        is faster but will not let Python's garbage collector free memory
        after deleting the data, and if the original data is overwritten, so will
        this buffer.
        Ignored when not using ``refit_buffer``.
    assume_unique_reward : bool
        Whether to assume that only one arm has a reward per observation. If set to 'True',
        whenever an arm receives a reward, the classifiers for all other arms will be
        fit to that observation too, having negative label.
    active_choice : None or str in {'min', 'max', 'weighted'}
        How to select arms when predictions are below the threshold. If passing None, selects them at random (default).
        If passing 'min', 'max' or 'weighted', selects them in the same way as 'ActiveExplorer'.
        Non-random active selection requires being able to calculate gradients (gradients for logistic regression and linear regression (from this package)
        are already defined with an option 'auto' below).
    f_grad_norm : None, str 'auto', list, or function(base_algorithm, X, pred) -> array (n_samples, 2)
        (When passing ``active_choice``)
        Function that calculates the row-wise norm of the gradient from observations in X if their class were
        Function that calculates the row-wise norm of the gradient from observations in X if their class were
        negative (first column) or positive (second column).
        Can also use different functions for each arm, in which case it
        accepts them as a list of functions with length equal to ``nchoices``.
        The option 'auto' will only work with scikit-learn's 'LogisticRegression', 'SGDClassifier', and 'RidgeClassifier';
        with stochQN's 'StochasticLogisticRegression';
        and with this package's 'LinearRegression'.
    case_one_class : str 'auto', 'zero', None, list, or function(X, n_pos, n_neg, rng) -> array(n_samples, 2)
        (When passing ``active_choice``)
        If some arm/choice/class has only rewards of one type, many models will fail to fit, and consequently the gradients
        will be undefined. Likewise, if the model has not been fit, the gradient might also be undefined, and this requires a workaround.
            * If passing 'None', will assume that ``base_algorithm`` can be fit to
              data of only-positive or only-negative class without problems, and that
              it can calculate gradients and predictions with a ``base_algorithm``
              object that has not been fitted. Be aware that the methods 'predict',
              'predict_proba', and 'decision_function' in ``base_algorithm`` might be
              overwritten with another method that wraps it in a try-catch block, so
              don't rely on it producing errors when unfitted.
            * If passing a function, will take the output of it as the row-wise
              gradient norms when it compares them against other arms/classes, with
              the first column having the values if the observations were of negative
              class, and the second column if they were positive class. The inputs to this
              function (signature described above) are the number of positive and negative examples
              that have been observed, and a ``Generator`` object from NumPy to use
              for generating random numbers.
            * If passing a list, will assume each entry is a function as described
              above, to be used with each corresponding arm.
            * If passing 'auto', will generate random numbers:

                * negative: ~ Gamma(log10(n_features) / (n_pos+1)/(n_pos+n_neg+2), log10(n_features)).

                * positive: ~ Gamma(log10(n_features) * (n_pos+1)/(n_pos+n_neg+2), log10(n_features)).

            * If passing 'zero', it will output zero whenever models have not been fitted.
        Note that the theoretically correct approach for a logistic regression would
        be to assume models with all-zero coefficients, in which case the gradient
        is defined in the absence of any data, but this tends to produce bad end
        results.
    random_state : int, None, RandomState, or Generator
        Either an integer which will be used as seed for initializing a
        ``Generator`` object for random number generation, a ``RandomState``
        object (from NumPy) from which to draw an integer, or a ``Generator``
        object (from NumPy), which will be used directly.
        While this controls random number generation for this meteheuristic,
        there can still be other sources of variations upon re-runs, such as
        data aggregations in parallel (e.g. from OpenMP or BLAS functions).
    njobs : int or None
        Number of parallel jobs to run. If passing None will set it to 1. If passing -1 will
        set it to the number of CPU cores. Note that if the base algorithm is itself parallelized,
        this might result in a slowdown as both compete for available threads, so don't set
        parallelization in both. The parallelization uses shared memory, thus you will only
        see a speed up if your base classifier releases the Python GIL, and will
        otherwise result in slower runs.

    """
    Explore First, a.k.a. Explore-Then-Exploit
    
    Selects random actions for the first N predictions, after which it selects the
    best arm only, according to its estimates.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    base_algorithm : obj
        Base binary classifier for which each sample for each class will be fit.
        Will look for, in this order:
            1) A 'predict_proba' method with outputs (n_samples, 2), values in [0,1], rows suming to 1
            2) A 'decision_function' method with unbounded outputs (n_samples,) to which it will apply a sigmoid function.
            3) A 'predict' method with outputs (n_samples,) with values in [0,1].
        Can also pass a list with a different (or already-fit) classifier for each arm.
    nchoices : int or list-like
        Number of arms/labels to choose from. Can also pass a list, array, or Series with arm names, in which case
        the outputs from predict will follow these names and arms can be dropped by name, and new ones added with a
        custom name.
    explore_rounds : int
        Number of rounds to wait before exploitation mode.
        Will switch after making N predictions.
    prob_active_choice : float (0, 1)
        Probability of choosing explore-mode actions according to active
        learning criteria. Pass zero for choosing everything at random.
    active_choice : str, one of 'weighted', 'max' or 'min'
        How to calculate the gradient that an observation would have on the loss
        function for each classifier, given that it could be either class (positive or negative)
        for the classifier that predicts each arm. If weighted, they are weighted by the same
        probability estimates from the base algorithm.
    f_grad_norm : None, str 'auto' or function(base_algorithm, X, pred) -> array (n_samples, 2)
        (When passing ``active_choice``)
        Function that calculates the row-wise norm of the gradient from observations in X if their class were
        negative (first column) or positive (second column).
        Can also use different functions for each arm, in which case it
        accepts them as a list of functions with length equal to ``nchoices``.
        The option 'auto' will only work with scikit-learn's 'LogisticRegression', 'SGDClassifier' (log-loss only), and 'RidgeClassifier';
        with stochQN's 'StochasticLogisticRegression';
        and with this package's 'LinearRegression'.
        Ignored when passing ``prob_active_choice=0.``
    case_one_class : str 'auto', 'zero', None, list, or function(X, n_pos, n_neg, rng) -> array(n_samples, 2)
        (When passing ``active_choice``)
        If some arm/choice/class has only rewards of one type, many models will fail to fit, and consequently the gradients
        will be undefined. Likewise, if the model has not been fit, the gradient might also be undefined, and this requires a workaround.
            * If passing 'None', will assume that ``base_algorithm`` can be fit to
              data of only-positive or only-negative class without problems, and that
              it can calculate gradients and predictions with a ``base_algorithm``
              object that has not been fitted. Be aware that the methods 'predict',
              'predict_proba', and 'decision_function' in ``base_algorithm`` might be
              overwritten with another method that wraps it in a try-catch block, so
              don't rely on it producing errors when unfitted.
            * If passing a function, will take the output of it as the row-wise
              gradient norms when it compares them against other arms/classes, with
              the first column having the values if the observations were of negative
              class, and the second column if they were positive class. The inputs to this
              function (signature described above) are the number of positive and negative examples
              that have been observed, and a ``Generator`` object from NumPy to use
              for generating random numbers.
            * If passing a list, will assume each entry is a function as described
              above, to be used with each corresponding arm.
            * If passing 'auto', will generate random numbers:

                * negative: ~ Gamma(log10(n_features) / (n_pos+1)/(n_pos+n_neg+2), log10(n_features)).

                * positive: ~ Gamma(log10(n_features) * (n_pos+1)/(n_pos+n_neg+2), log10(n_features)).

            * If passing 'zero', it will output zero whenever models have not been fitted.
        Note that the theoretically correct approach for a logistic regression would
        be to assume models with all-zero coefficients, in which case the gradient
        is defined in the absence of any data, but this tends to produce bad end
        results.
        Ignored when passing ``prob_active_choice=0.``
    beta_prior : str 'auto', None, tuple ((a,b), n), or list[tuple((a,b), n)]
        If not 'None', when there are less than 'n' samples with and without
        a reward from a given arm, it will predict the score for that class as a
        random number drawn from a beta distribution with the prior
        specified by 'a' and 'b'. If set to "auto", will be calculated as:
            beta_prior = ((2/log2(nchoices), 4), 2)
        Can also pass different priors per arm, in which case they should be passed
        as a list of tuples.
        Recommended to use only one of ``beta_prior`` or ``smoothing``.
    smoothing : None, tuple (a,b), or list
        If not None, predictions will be smoothed as yhat_smooth = (yhat*n + a)/(n + b),
        where 'n' is the number of times each arm was chosen in the training data.
        Can also pass it as a list of tuples with different 'a' and 'b' parameters for each arm
        (e.g. if there are arm features, these parameters can be determined through a different model).
        This will not work well with non-probabilistic classifiers such as SVM, in which case you might
        want to define a class that embeds it with some recalibration built-in.
        Recommended to use only one of ``beta_prior`` or ``smoothing``.
    noise_to_smooth : bool
        If passing ``smoothing``, whether to add a small amount of random
        noise :math:`\sim Uniform(0, 10^{-12})` in order to break ties at random instead of
        choosing the smallest arm index.
        Ignored when passing ``smoothing=None``.
    batch_train : bool
        Whether the base algorithm will be fit to the data in batches as it comes (streaming),
        or to the whole dataset each time it is refit. Requires a classifier with a
        'partial_fit' method.
    refit_buffer : int or None
        Number of observations per arm to keep as a reserve for passing to
        'partial_fit'. If passing it, up until the moment there are at least this
        number of observations for a given arm, that arm will keep the observations
        when calling 'fit' and 'partial_fit', and will translate calls to
        'partial_fit' to calls to 'fit' with the new plus stored observations.
        After the reserve number is reached, calls to 'partial_fit' will enlarge
        the data batch with the stored observations, and old stored observations
        will be gradually replaced with the new ones (at random, not on a FIFO
        basis). This technique can greatly enchance the performance when fitting
        the data in batches, but memory consumption can grow quite large.
        If passing sparse CSR matrices as input to 'fit' and 'partial_fit',
        these will be converted to dense once they go into this reserve, and
        then converted back to CSR to augment the new data.
        Calls to 'fit' will override this reserve.
        Ignored when passing 'batch_train=False'.
    deep_copy_buffer : bool
        Whether to make deep copies of the data that is stored in the
        reserve for ``refit_buffer``. If passing 'False', when the reserve is
        not yet full, these will only store shallow copies of the data, which
        is faster but will not let Python's garbage collector free memory
        after deleting the data, and if the original data is overwritten, so will
        this buffer.
        Ignored when not using ``refit_buffer``.
    assume_unique_reward : bool
        Whether to assume that only one arm has a reward per observation. If set to 'True',
        whenever an arm receives a reward, the classifiers for all other arms will be
        fit to that observation too, having negative label.
    random_state : int, None, RandomState, or Generator
        Either an integer which will be used as seed for initializing a
        ``Generator`` object for random number generation, a ``RandomState``
        object (from NumPy) from which to draw an integer, or a ``Generator``
        object (from NumPy), which will be used directly.
        While this controls random number generation for this meteheuristic,
        there can still be other sources of variations upon re-runs, such as
        data aggregations in parallel (e.g. from OpenMP or BLAS functions).
    njobs : int or None
        Number of parallel jobs to run. If passing None will set it to 1. If passing -1 will
        set it to the number of CPU cores. Note that if the base algorithm is itself parallelized,
        this might result in a slowdown as both compete for available threads, so don't set
        parallelization in both. The parallelization uses shared memory, thus you will only
        see a speed up if your base classifier releases the Python GIL, and will
        otherwise result in slower runs.

class ActiveExplorer(_ActivePolicy, _BasePolicyWithExploit):
    """
    Active Explorer
    
    Selects a proportion of actions according to an active learning heuristic based on gradient.
    Works only for differentiable and preferably smooth functions.
    
    Note
    ----
    Here, for the predictions that are made according to an active learning heuristic
    (these are selected at random, just like in Epsilon-Greedy), the guiding heuristic
    is the gradient that the observation, having either label (either weighted by the estimted
    probability, or taking the maximum or minimum), would produce on each model that
    predicts a class, given the current coefficients for that model. This of course requires
    being able to calculate gradients - package comes with pre-defined gradient functions for
    linear and logistic regression, and allows passing custom functions for others.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    base_algorithm : obj
        Base binary classifier for which each sample for each class will be fit.
        Will look for, in this order:
            1) A 'predict_proba' method with outputs (n_samples, 2), values in [0,1], rows suming to 1
            2) A 'decision_function' method with unbounded outputs (n_samples,) to which it will apply a sigmoid function.
            3) A 'predict' method with outputs (n_samples,) with values in [0,1].
        Can also pass a list with a different (or already-fit) classifier for each arm.
    nchoices : int or list-like
        Number of arms/labels to choose from. Can also pass a list, array, or Series with arm names, in which case
        the outputs from predict will follow these names and arms can be dropped by name, and new ones added with a
        custom name.
    f_grad_norm : str 'auto' or function(base_algorithm, X, pred) -> array (n_samples, 2)
        Function that calculates the row-wise norm of the gradient from observations in X if their class were
        negative (first column) or positive (second column).
        Can also use different functions for each arm, in which case it
        accepts them as a list of functions with length equal to ``nchoices``.
        The option 'auto' will only work with scikit-learn's 'LogisticRegression', 'SGDClassifier' (log-loss only), and 'RidgeClassifier';
        with stochQN's 'StochasticLogisticRegression';
        and with this package's 'LinearRegression'.
    case_one_class : str 'auto', 'zero', None, or function(X, n_pos, n_neg, rng) -> array(n_samples, 2)
        If some arm/choice/class has only rewards of one type, many models will fail to fit, and consequently the gradients
        will be undefined. Likewise, if the model has not been fit, the gradient might also be undefined, and this requires a workaround.
            * If passing 'None', will assume that ``base_algorithm`` can be fit to
              data of only-positive or only-negative class without problems, and that
              it can calculate gradients and predictions with a ``base_algorithm``
              object that has not been fitted. Be aware that the methods 'predict',
              'predict_proba', and 'decision_function' in ``base_algorithm`` might be
              overwritten with another method that wraps it in a try-catch block, so
              don't rely on it producing errors when unfitted.
            * If passing a function, will take the output of it as the row-wise
              gradient norms when it compares them against other arms/classes, with
              the first column having the values if the observations were of negative
              class, and the second column if they were positive class. The other
              inputs to this function are the number of positive and negative examples
              that have been observed, and a ``Generator`` object from NumPy to use
              for generating random numbers.
            * If passing a list, will assume each entry is a function as described
              above, to be used with each corresponding arm.
            * If passing 'auto', will generate random numbers:

                * negative: ~ Gamma(log10(n_features) / (n_pos+1)/(n_pos+n_neg+2), log10(n_features)).

                * positive: ~ Gamma(log10(n_features) * (n_pos+1)/(n_pos+n_neg+2), log10(n_features)).

            * If passing 'zero', it will output zero whenever models have not been fitted.
        Note that the theoretically correct approach for a logistic regression would
        be to assume models with all-zero coefficients, in which case the gradient
        is defined in the absence of any data, but this tends to produce bad end
        results.
    active_choice : str in {'min', 'max', 'weighted'}
        How to calculate the gradient that an observation would have on the loss
        function for each classifier, given that it could be either class (positive or negative)
        for the classifier that predicts each arm. If weighted, they are weighted by the same
        probability estimates from the base algorithm.
    explore_prob : float (0,1)
        Probability of selecting an action according to active learning criteria.
    decay : float (0,1)
        After each prediction, the probability of selecting an arm according to active
        learning criteria is set to p = p*decay
    beta_prior : str 'auto', None, tuple ((a,b), n), or list[tuple((a,b), n)]
        If not 'None', when there are less than 'n' samples with and without
        a reward from a given arm, it will predict the score for that class as a
        random number drawn from a beta distribution with the prior
        specified by 'a' and 'b'. If set to "auto", will be calculated as:
            beta_prior = ((2/log2(nchoices), 4), 2)
        Can also pass different priors per arm, in which case they should be passed
        as a list of tuples.
        This parameter can have a very large impact in the end results, and it's
        recommended to tune it accordingly - scenarios with low expected reward rates
        should have priors that result in drawing small random numbers, whereas
        scenarios with large expected reward rates should have stronger priors and
        tend towards larger random numbers. Also, the more arms there are, the smaller
        the optimal expected value for these random numbers.
        Recommended to use only one of ``beta_prior`` or ``smoothing``.
    smoothing : None, tuple (a,b), or list
        If not None, predictions will be smoothed as yhat_smooth = (yhat*n + a)/(n + b),
        where 'n' is the number of times each arm was chosen in the training data.
        Can also pass it as a list of tuples with different 'a' and 'b' parameters for each arm
        (e.g. if there are arm features, these parameters can be determined through a different model).
        Recommended to use only one of ``beta_prior`` or ``smoothing``.
    noise_to_smooth : bool
        If passing ``smoothing``, whether to add a small amount of random
        noise :math:`\sim Uniform(0, 10^{-12})` in order to break ties at random instead of
        choosing the smallest arm index.
        Ignored when passing ``smoothing=None``.
    batch_train : bool
        Whether the base algorithm will be fit to the data in batches as it comes (streaming),
        or to the whole dataset each time it is refit. Requires a classifier with a
        'partial_fit' method.
    refit_buffer : int or None
        Number of observations per arm to keep as a reserve for passing to
        'partial_fit'. If passing it, up until the moment there are at least this
        number of observations for a given arm, that arm will keep the observations
        when calling 'fit' and 'partial_fit', and will translate calls to
        'partial_fit' to calls to 'fit' with the new plus stored observations.
        After the reserve number is reached, calls to 'partial_fit' will enlarge
        the data batch with the stored observations, and old stored observations
        will be gradually replaced with the new ones (at random, not on a FIFO
        basis). This technique can greatly enchance the performance when fitting
        the data in batches, but memory consumption can grow quite large.
        If passing sparse CSR matrices as input to 'fit' and 'partial_fit',
        these will be converted to dense once they go into this reserve, and
        then converted back to CSR to augment the new data.
        Calls to 'fit' will override this reserve.
        Ignored when passing 'batch_train=False'.
    deep_copy_buffer : bool
        Whether to make deep copies of the data that is stored in the
        reserve for ``refit_buffer``. If passing 'False', when the reserve is
        not yet full, these will only store shallow copies of the data, which
        is faster but will not let Python's garbage collector free memory
        after deleting the data, and if the original data is overwritten, so will
        this buffer.
        Ignored when not using ``refit_buffer``.
    assume_unique_reward : bool
        Whether to assume that only one arm has a reward per observation. If set to 'True',
        whenever an arm receives a reward, the classifiers for all other arms will be
        fit to that observation too, having negative label.
    random_state : int, None, RandomState, or Generator
        Either an integer which will be used as seed for initializing a
        ``Generator`` object for random number generation, a ``RandomState``
        object (from NumPy) from which to draw an integer, or a ``Generator``
        object (from NumPy), which will be used directly.
        While this controls random number generation for this meteheuristic,
        there can still be other sources of variations upon re-runs, such as
        data aggregations in parallel (e.g. from OpenMP or BLAS functions).
    njobs : int or None
        Number of parallel jobs to run. If passing None will set it to 1. If passing -1 will
        set it to the number of CPU cores. Note that if the base algorithm is itself parallelized,
        this might result in a slowdown as both compete for available threads, so don't set
        parallelization in both. The parallelization uses shared memory, thus you will only
        see a speed up if your base classifier releases the Python GIL, and will
        otherwise result in slower runs.

    Parameters
    ----------
    base_algorithm : obj
        Base binary classifier for which each sample for each class will be fit.
        Will look for, in this order:
            1) A 'predict_proba' method with outputs (n_samples, 2), values in [0,1], rows suming to 1, to which it
               will apply an inverse sigmoid function.
            2) A 'decision_function' method with unbounded outputs (n_samples,).
            3) A 'predict' method outputting (n_samples,), values in [0,1], to which it will apply an inverse sigmoid function.
        Can also pass a list with a different (or already-fit) classifier for each arm.
    nchoices : int or list-like
        Number of arms/labels to choose from. Can also pass a list, array, or Series with arm names, in which case
        the outputs from predict will follow these names and arms can be dropped by name, and new ones added with a
        custom name.
    multiplier : float or None
        Number by which to multiply the outputs from the base algorithm before applying the softmax function
        (i.e. will take softmax(yhat * multiplier)).
    inflation_rate : float or None
        Number by which to multiply the multipier rate after every prediction, i.e. after making
        't' predictions, the multiplier will be 'multiplier_t = multiplier * inflation_rate^t'.
    beta_prior : str 'auto', None, tuple ((a,b), n), or list[tuple((a,b), n)]
        If not 'None', when there are less than 'n' samples with and without
        a reward from a given arm, it will predict the score for that class as a
        random number drawn from a beta distribution with the prior
        specified by 'a' and 'b'. If set to "auto", will be calculated as:
            beta_prior = ((2/log2(nchoices), 4), 2)
        Can also pass different priors per arm, in which case they should be passed
        as a list of tuples.
        This parameter can have a very large impact in the end results, and it's

        should have priors that result in drawing small random numbers, whereas
        scenarios with large expected reward rates should have stronger priors and

        the optimal expected value for these random numbers.
        Recommended to use only one of ``beta_prior`` or ``smoothing``.
    smoothing : None, tuple (a,b), or list
        If not None, predictions will be smoothed as yhat_smooth = (yhat*n + a)/(n + b),
        where 'n' is the number of times each arm was chosen in the training data.
        Can also pass it as a list of tuples with different 'a' and 'b' parameters for each arm
        (e.g. if there are arm features, these parameters can be determined through a different model).
        This will not work well with non-probabilistic classifiers such as SVM, in which case you might
        want to define a class that embeds it with some recalibration built-in.
        Recommended to use only one of ``beta_prior`` or ``smoothing``.
    noise_to_smooth : bool

        Either an integer which will be used as seed for initializing a

        there can still be other sources of variations upon re-runs, such as
        data aggregations in parallel (e.g. from OpenMP or BLAS functions).
    njobs : int or None
        Number of parallel jobs to run. If passing None will set it to 1. If passing -1 will
        set it to the number of CPU cores. Note that if the base algorithm is itself parallelized,
        this might result in a slowdown as both compete for available threads, so don't set
        parallelization in both. The parallelization uses shared memory, thus you will only
        see a speed up if your base classifier releases the Python GIL, and will
        otherwise result in slower runs.

class LinUCB(_BasePolicyWithExploit):
    """
    LinUCB

    Note
    ----
    This strategy requires each fitted model to store a square matrix with
    dimension equal to the number of features. Thus, memory consumption can grow
    very high with this method.

    Note
    ----
    The 'X' data (covariates) should ideally be centered before passing them
    to 'fit', 'partial_fit', 'predict'.

    Note
    ----
    The default hyperparameters here are meant to match the original reference, but
    it's recommended to change them. Particularly: use ``beta_prior`` instead of
    ``ucb_from_empty``, decrease ``alpha``, and maybe increase ``lambda_``.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    nchoices : int or list-like
        Number of arms/labels to choose from. Can also pass a list, array, or Series with arm names, in which case
        the outputs from predict will follow these names and arms can be dropped by name, and new ones added with a
        custom name.
    alpha : float
        Parameter to control the upper confidence bound (more is higher).
    lambda_ : float > 0
        Regularization parameter. References assumed this would always be equal to 1, but this
        implementation allows to change it.
    fit_intercept : bool
        Whether to add an intercept term to the coefficients.
    use_float : bool
        Whether to use C 'float' type for the required matrices. If passing 'False',
        will use C 'double'. Be aware that memory usage for this model can grow
        very large.
    method : str, one of 'chol' or 'sm'
        Method used to fit the model. Options are:

        ``'chol'``:
            Uses the Cholesky decomposition to solve the linear system from the
            least-squares closed-form each time 'fit' or 'partial_fit' is called.
            This is likely to be faster when fitting the model to a large number
            of observations at once, and is able to better exploit multi-threading.
        ``'sm'``:
            Starts with an inverse diagonal matrix and updates it as each
            new observation comes using the Sherman-Morrison formula, thus
            never explicitly solving the linear system, nor needing to calculate
            a matrix inverse. This is likely to be faster when fitting the model
            to small batches of observations. Be aware that with this method, it
            will add regularization to the intercept if passing 'fit_intercept=True'.
    ucb_from_empty : bool
        Whether to make upper confidence bounds on arms with no observations according
        to the formula, as suggested in the references (ties are broken at random for
        them). Choosing this option leads to policies that usually start making random
        predictions until having sampled from all arms, and as such, it's not
        recommended when the number of arms is large relative to the number of rounds.
        Instead, it's recommended to use ``beta_prior``, which acts in the same way
        as for the other policies in this library.
    beta_prior : str 'auto', None, tuple ((a,b), n), or list[tuple((a,b), n)]
        If not 'None', when there are less than 'n' samples with and without
        a reward from a given arm, it will predict the score for that class as a
        random number drawn from a beta distribution with the prior
        specified by 'a' and 'b'. If set to "auto", will be calculated as:
            beta_prior = ((3/log2(nchoices), 4), 2).
        Can also pass different priors per arm, in which case they should be passed
        as a list of tuples.
        This parameter can have a very large impact in the end results, and it's
        recommended to tune it accordingly - scenarios with low expected reward rates
        should have priors that result in drawing small random numbers, whereas
        scenarios with large expected reward rates should have stronger priors and
        tend towards larger random numbers. Also, the more arms there are, the smaller
        the optimal expected value for these random numbers.
        Ignored when passing ``ucb_from_empty=True``.
    smoothing : None, tuple (a,b), or list
        If not None, predictions will be smoothed as yhat_smooth = (yhat*n + a)/(n + b),
        where 'n' is the number of times each arm was chosen in the training data.
        Can also pass it as a list of tuples with different 'a' and 'b' parameters for each arm
        (e.g. if there are arm features, these parameters can be determined through a different model).
        Recommended to use only one of ``beta_prior`` or ``smoothing``.
        Note that it is technically incorrect to apply smoothing like this (because
        the predictions from models are not bounded between zero and one), but
        if neither ``beta_prior``, nor ``smoothing`` are passed, the policy can get
        stuck in situations in which it will only choose actions from the first batch
        of observations to which it is fit (if using ``ucb_from_empty=False``), or
        only from the first arms that show rewards (if using ``ucb_from_empty=True``).
    noise_to_smooth : bool
        If passing ``smoothing``, whether to add a small amount of random
        noise :math:`\sim Uniform(0, 10^{-12})` in order to break ties at random instead of
        choosing the smallest arm index.
        Ignored when passing ``smoothing=None``.
    assume_unique_reward : bool
        Whether to assume that only one arm has a reward per observation. If set to 'True',
        whenever an arm receives a reward, the classifiers for all other arms will be
        fit to that observation too, having negative label.
    random_state : int, None, RandomState, or Generator
        Either an integer which will be used as seed for initializing a
        ``Generator`` object for random number generation, a ``RandomState``
        object (from NumPy) from which to draw an integer, or a ``Generator``
        object (from NumPy), which will be used directly.
        While this controls random number generation for this meteheuristic,
        there can still be other sources of variations upon re-runs, such as
        data aggregations in parallel (e.g. from OpenMP or BLAS functions).
    njobs : int or None
        Number of parallel jobs to run. If passing None will set it to 1. If passing -1 will
        set it to the number of CPU cores. Be aware that the algorithm will use BLAS function calls,
        and if these have multi-threading enabled, it might result in a slow-down
        as both functions compete for available threads.

    Parameters
    ----------
    nchoices : int or list-like
        Number of arms/labels to choose from. Can also pass a list, array, or Series with arm names, in which case
        the outputs from predict will follow these names and arms can be dropped by name, and new ones added with a

    lambda_ : float > 0
        Regularization parameter. References assumed this would always be equal to 1, but this

    fit_intercept : bool
        Whether to add an intercept term to the coefficients.
    v_sq : float
        Parameter by which to multiply the covariance matrix (more means higher variance).
        It is recommended to decrease it from the default value of 1.
    sample_from : str, one of "coef", "ci"
        Whether to make predictions by sampling the model coefficients or by
        sampling the predicted value from an interval centered around the coefficients.
        If sampling from the coefficients, it's highly recommended to use ``method="chol"``
        as it will be faster and more precise.
    n_presampled : None or int
        If sampling from coefficients, this denotes a number of coefficients to pre-sample
        after calling 'fit' and/or 'partial_fit', which will be used later in the predictions. Pre-sampling
        a large number of coefficients can help to speed up predictions at the expense
        of longer fitting times, and is recommended if there is a large number of predictions
        between calls to 'fit' or 'partial_fit'.
        If passing 'None' (the default), will not pre-sample a finite number of the coefficients
        at fitting time, but will rather sample (different) coefficients in calls to 'predict'.
        Ignored when passing ``sample_from="ci"``.
    sample_unique : bool
        Whether to sample different coefficients each time a prediction is to
        be made. If passing 'False', when calling 'predict', it will sample
        the same coefficients for all the observations in the same call to
        'predict', whereas if passing 'True', will use a different set of
        coefficients for each observations. Passing 'False' leads to an
        approach which is theoretically wrong, but as sampling coefficients
        can be very slow, using 'False' can provide a reasonable speed up
        without much of a performance penalty.
        Ignored when passing ``sample_from="ci"`` or ``n_presampled``.
    use_float : bool
        Whether to use C 'float' type for the required matrices. If passing 'False',
        will use C 'double'. Be aware that memory usage for this model can grow
        very large, and that it is more prone to suffer from numeric precision
        problems compared to its UCB counterpart.
    method : str, one of 'chol' or 'sm'
        Method used to fit the model. Options are:

        ``'chol'``:
            Uses the Cholesky decomposition to solve the linear system from the
            least-squares closed-form each time 'fit' or 'partial_fit' is called.
            This is likely to be faster when fitting the model to a large number

            never explicitly solving the linear system, nor needing to calculate
            a matrix inverse. This is likely to be faster when fitting the model
            to small batches of observations. Be aware that with this method, it
            will add regularization to the intercept if passing 'fit_intercept=True'.

        Note that, even when using "sm" here, if sampling from the coefficients, it
        will need after each update to calculate eigen values of the covariance or
        inverse covariance matrix, so it won't be as fast as LinUCB.
    beta_prior : str 'auto', None, tuple ((a,b), n), or list[tuple((a,b), n)]
        If not 'None', when there are less than 'n' samples with and without
        a reward from a given arm, it will predict the score for that class as a
        random number drawn from a beta distribution with the prior
        specified by 'a' and 'b'. If set to "auto", will be calculated as:
            beta_prior = ((2/log2(nchoices), 4), 2)
        Can also pass different priors per arm, in which case they should be passed
        as a list of tuples.
        This parameter can have a very large impact in the end results, and it's

        If not None, predictions will be smoothed as yhat_smooth = (yhat*n + a)/(n + b),
        where 'n' is the number of times each arm was chosen in the training data.
        Can also pass it as a list of tuples with different 'a' and 'b' parameters for each arm
        (e.g. if there are arm features, these parameters can be determined through a different model).
        Recommended to use only one of ``beta_prior`` or ``smoothing``.
        Note that it is technically incorrect to apply smoothing like this (because
        the predictions from models are not bounded between zero and one), but
        if neither ``beta_prior``, nor ``smoothing`` are passed, the policy can get
        stuck in situations in which it will only choose actions from the first batch
        of observations to which it is fit.
    noise_to_smooth : bool
        If passing ``smoothing``, whether to add a small amount of random
        noise :math:`\sim Uniform(0, 10^{-12})` in order to break ties at random instead of
        choosing the smallest arm index.
        Ignored when passing ``smoothing=None``.
    assume_unique_reward : bool
        Whether to assume that only one arm has a reward per observation. If set to 'True',
        whenever an arm receives a reward, the classifiers for all other arms will be
        fit to that observation too, having negative label.
    random_state : int, None, RandomState, or Generator
        Either an integer which will be used as seed for initializing a
        ``Generator`` object for random number generation, a ``RandomState``
        object (from NumPy) from which to draw an integer, or a ``Generator``
        object (from NumPy), which will be used directly.
        While this controls random number generation for this meteheuristic,
        there can still be other sources of variations upon re-runs, such as
        data aggregations in parallel (e.g. from OpenMP or BLAS functions).
    njobs : int or None
        Number of parallel jobs to run. If passing None will set it to 1. If passing -1 will
        set it to the number of CPU cores. Be aware that the algorithm will use BLAS function calls,
        and if these have multi-threading enabled, it might result in a slow-down
        as both functions compete for available threads.

    Parametric Thompson Sampling

    Performs Thompson sampling using a beta distribution, with parameters given
    by the predicted probability from the base algorithm multiplied by the number
    of observations seen from each arm.

    Parameters
    ----------
    base_algorithm : obj
        Base binary classifier for which each sample for each class will be fit.
        Will look for, in this order:
            1) A 'predict_proba' method with outputs (n_samples, 2), values in [0,1], rows suming to 1
            2) A 'decision_function' method with unbounded outputs (n_samples,) to which it will apply a sigmoid function.
            3) A 'predict' method with outputs (n_samples,) with values in [0,1].
        Can also pass a list with a different (or already-fit) classifier for each arm.
    nchoices : int or list-like
        Number of arms/labels to choose from. Can also pass a list, array, or Series with arm names, in which case
        the outputs from predict will follow these names and arms can be dropped by name, and new ones added with a
        custom name.
    beta_prior : str 'auto', None, tuple ((a,b), n), or list[tuple((a,b), n)]
        If not 'None', when there are less than 'n' samples with and without
        a reward from a given arm, it will predict the score for that class as a
        random number drawn from a beta distribution with the prior
        specified by 'a' and 'b'. If set to "auto", will be calculated as:
            beta_prior = ((2/log2(nchoices), 4), 2)
        Can also pass different priors per arm, in which case they should be passed
        as a list of tuples.
        This parameter can have a very large impact in the end results, and it's
        recommended to tune it accordingly - scenarios with low expected reward rates
        should have priors that result in drawing small random numbers, whereas
        scenarios with large expected reward rates should have stronger priors and
        tend towards larger random numbers. Also, the more arms there are, the smaller
        the optimal expected value for these random numbers.
        Recommended to use only one of ``beta_prior`` or ``smoothing``.
    beta_prior_ts : tuple(float, float)
        Beta prior used for the distribution from which to draw probabilities given
        the base algorithm's estimates. This is independent of ``beta_prior``, and
        they will not be used together under the same arm. Pass '(0,0)' for no prior.
    smoothing : None, tuple (a,b), or list
        If not None, predictions will be smoothed as yhat_smooth = (yhat*n + a)/(n + b),
        where 'n' is the number of times each arm was chosen in the training data.
        Can also pass it as a list of tuples with different 'a' and 'b' parameters for each arm
        (e.g. if there are arm features, these parameters can be determined through a different model).
        This will not work well with non-probabilistic classifiers such as SVM, in which case you might
        want to define a class that embeds it with some recalibration built-in.
        Recommended to use only one of ``beta_prior`` or ``smoothing``.
    noise_to_smooth : bool
        If passing ``smoothing``, whether to add a small amount of random
        noise :math:`\sim Uniform(0, 10^{-12})` in order to break ties at random instead of
        choosing the smallest arm index.
        Ignored when passing ``smoothing=None``.
    batch_train : bool
        Whether the base algorithm will be fit to the data in batches as it comes (streaming),
        or to the whole dataset each time it is refit. Requires a classifier with a
        'partial_fit' method.
    refit_buffer : int or None
        Number of observations per arm to keep as a reserve for passing to
        'partial_fit'. If passing it, up until the moment there are at least this
        number of observations for a given arm, that arm will keep the observations
        when calling 'fit' and 'partial_fit', and will translate calls to
        'partial_fit' to calls to 'fit' with the new plus stored observations.
        After the reserve number is reached, calls to 'partial_fit' will enlarge
        the data batch with the stored observations, and old stored observations
        will be gradually replaced with the new ones (at random, not on a FIFO
        basis). This technique can greatly enchance the performance when fitting
        the data in batches, but memory consumption can grow quite large.
        If passing sparse CSR matrices as input to 'fit' and 'partial_fit',
        these will be converted to dense once they go into this reserve, and
        then converted back to CSR to augment the new data.
        Calls to 'fit' will override this reserve.
        Ignored when passing 'batch_train=False'.
    deep_copy_buffer : bool
        Whether to make deep copies of the data that is stored in the
        reserve for ``refit_buffer``. If passing 'False', when the reserve is
        not yet full, these will only store shallow copies of the data, which
        is faster but will not let Python's garbage collector free memory
        after deleting the data, and if the original data is overwritten, so will
        this buffer.
        Ignored when not using ``refit_buffer``.
    assume_unique_reward : bool
        Whether to assume that only one arm has a reward per observation. If set to 'True',
        whenever an arm receives a reward, the classifiers for all other arms will be
        fit to that observation too, having negative label.
    random_state : int, None, RandomState, or Generator
        Either an integer which will be used as seed for initializing a
        ``Generator`` object for random number generation, a ``RandomState``
        object (from NumPy) from which to draw an integer, or a ``Generator``
        object (from NumPy), which will be used directly.

        there can still be other sources of variations upon re-runs, such as
        data aggregations in parallel (e.g. from OpenMP or BLAS functions).
    njobs : int or None
        Number of parallel jobs to run. If passing None will set it to 1. If passing -1 will
        set it to the number of CPU cores. Note that if the base algorithm is itself parallelized,
        this might result in a slowdown as both compete for available threads, so don't set
        parallelization in both. The parallelization uses shared memory, thus you will only
        see a speed up if your base classifier releases the Python GIL, and will
        otherwise result in slower runs.

    Tree-partitioned Upper Confidence Bound

    Fits decision trees having non-contextual multi-armed UCB bandits at each leaf.

    Note
    ----
    This method fits only one tree per arm. As such, it's not recommended for

    Parameters
    ----------
    nchoices : int or list-like
        Number of arms/labels to choose from. Can also pass a list, array, or Series with arm names, in which case

    percentile : int [0,100]
        Percentile of the confidence interval to take.
    ucb_prior : tuple(float, float)
        Prior for the upper confidence bounds generated at each tree leaf. First
        number will be added to the number of positives, and second number to
        the number of negatives. If passing ``beta_prior=None``, will use these alone
        to generate an upper confidence bound and will break ties at random.
    beta_prior : str 'auto', None, tuple ((a,b), n), or list[tuple((a,b), n)]
        If not 'None', when there are less than 'n' samples with and without
        a reward from a given arm, it will predict the score for that class as a
        random number drawn from a beta distribution with the prior
        specified by 'a' and 'b'. If set to "auto", will be calculated as:
            beta_prior = ((3/log2(nchoices), 4), 2)
        Can also pass different priors per arm, in which case they should be passed
        as a list of tuples.

        tend towards larger random numbers. Also, the more arms there are, the smaller
        the optimal expected value for these random numbers.
        Note that this method calculates upper bounds rather than expectations, so the 'a'
        parameter should be higher than for other methods.
        Recommended to use only one of ``beta_prior`` or ``smoothing``.
    smoothing : None, tuple (a,b), or list
        If not None, predictions will be smoothed as yhat_smooth = (yhat*n + a)/(n + b),
        where 'n' is the number of times each arm was chosen in the training data.
        Can also pass it as a list of tuples with different 'a' and 'b' parameters for each arm

    assume_unique_reward : bool
        Whether to assume that only one arm has a reward per observation. If set to 'True',
        whenever an arm receives a reward, the classifiers for all other arms will be

    random_state : int, None, RandomState, or Generator
        Either an integer which will be used as seed for initializing a

        object (from NumPy) from which to draw an integer, or a ``Generator``
        object (from NumPy), which will be used directly.
    njobs : int or None
        Number of parallel jobs to run. If passing None will set it to 1. If passing -1 will
        set it to the number of CPU cores. Note that it will not achieve a large
        degree of parallelization due to needing many Python computations with
        shared memory and no GIL releasing.
    *args : tuple
        Additional arguments to pass to the decision tree model (this policy uses
        SciKit-Learn's ``DecisionTreeClassifier`` - see their docs for more details).
        Note that passing ``random_state`` for ``DecisionTreeClassifier`` will have
        no effect as it will be set independently.
    **kwargs : dict
        Additional keyword arguments to pass to the decision tree model (this policy uses

    This method fits only one tree per arm. As such, it's not recommended for
    high-dimensional data.

    Note
    ----
    The default values for beta prior are as suggested in the reference paper.
    It is recommended to change it however.

    Parameters
    ----------
    nchoices : int or list-like
        Number of arms/labels to choose from. Can also pass a list, array, or Series with arm names, in which case
        the outputs from predict will follow these names and arms can be dropped by name, and new ones added with a
        custom name.
    beta_prior : str 'auto', tuple ((a,b), n), or list[tuple((a,b), n)]
        When there are less than 'n' samples with and without a reward from
        a given arm, it will predict the score
        for that class as a random number drawn from a beta distribution with the prior
        specified by 'a' and 'b'.
        If passing 'auto' (*which is not the default*), will use the same default as for
        the other policies in this library:
            beta_prior = ((2/log2(nchoices), 4), 2)
        Can also pass different priors per arm, in which case they should be passed
        as a list of tuples.
        Additionally, will use (a,b) as prior when sampling from the MAB at a given node.
    smoothing : None, tuple (a,b), or list
        If not None, predictions will be smoothed as yhat_smooth = (yhat*n + a)/(n + b),
        where 'n' is the number of times each arm was chosen in the training data.
        Can also pass it as a list of tuples with different 'a' and 'b' parameters for each arm
        (e.g. if there are arm features, these parameters can be determined through a different model).
        Not recommended for this method.
    noise_to_smooth : bool
        If passing ``smoothing``, whether to add a small amount of random
        noise :math:`\sim Uniform(0, 10^{-12})` in order to break ties at random instead of
        choosing the smallest arm index.
        Ignored when passing ``smoothing=None``.
    assume_unique_reward : bool
        Whether to assume that only one arm has a reward per observation. If set to 'True',
        whenever an arm receives a reward, the classifiers for all other arms will be
        fit to that observation too, having negative label.
    random_state : int, None, RandomState, or Generator
        Either an integer which will be used as seed for initializing a
        ``Generator`` object for random number generation, a ``RandomState``
        object (from NumPy) from which to draw an integer, or a ``Generator``
        object (from NumPy), which will be used directly.
    njobs : int or None
        Number of parallel jobs to run. If passing None will set it to 1. If passing -1 will
        set it to the number of CPU cores. Note that it will not achieve a large
        degree of parallelization due to needing many Python computations with
        shared memory and no GIL releasing.
    *args : tuple
        Additional arguments to pass to the decision tree model (this policy uses
        SciKit-Learn's ``DecisionTreeClassifier`` - see their docs for more details).
        Note that passing ``random_state`` for ``DecisionTreeClassifier`` will have
        no effect as it will be set independently.
    **kwargs : dict
        Additional keyword arguments to pass to the decision tree model (this policy uses
        SciKit-Learn's ``DecisionTreeClassifier`` - see their docs for more details).
        Note that passing ``random_state`` for ``DecisionTreeClassifier`` will have
        no effect as it will be set independently.
